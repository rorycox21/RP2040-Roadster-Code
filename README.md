# Model Roadster
Model Roadster controlled via custom bluetooth controller using BLE - bluetooth low energy.
Bluetooth controller code available [here](https://github.com/rorycox21/RP2040-Roadster-Code), written in Swift using Apple's Xcode.

## Introduction
For this project, I wanted to build fully functioning 'Model Roadster' which could be controlled via bluetooth from my iPhone.
